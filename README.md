# EES 4760 Apps
Various shiny apps related to teaching Agent-Based modeling using Railsback and Grimm, [*Agent-Based and Individual-Based Modeling*](http://www.railsback-grimm-abm-book.com/). These apps make life easier than using Excel to analyze submodels and behaviorspace output.

## analyze_behaviorspace
Upload a .csv file (table format) from a behaviorspace run and do some simple processing and plotting. Can be useful for turning a behaviorspace output file into something that's useful to analyze and plot with Excel.

## contour_plot
Interactive plot of countours of expected utility for Chapter 12, adding prediction to the business investor model

## jg-tif
My version of Pierre-Olivier Chasset's [Testing is Fun](https://github.com/chasset/tif) unit-testing library for NetLogo.
